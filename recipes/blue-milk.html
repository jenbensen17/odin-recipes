    <h2>"Blue Milk," also known as Bantha milk, is a famous beverage from the Star Wars universe. </h2>
    <p>Here's a recipe for creating your own Blue Milk inspired by the galaxy far, far away:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup blue food coloring</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by chilling your milk and ice cream in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. This will help keep your Blue Milk cold and refreshing.</li>
        <li>In a blender, combine the chilled milk, vanilla ice cream, blue food coloring, honey, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Blend the ingredients on high until the mixture is smooth and the blue color is evenly distributed. You can adjust the amount of food coloring to achieve your preferred shade of blue.</li>
        <li>Taste the Blue Milk and adjust the sweetness by adding more honey or sweetener if needed. Blend again to combine.</li>
        <li>Once your Blue Milk is ready, pour it into tall glasses or even a quirky Star Wars-themed container for a more authentic experience.</li>
        <li>Serve your Blue Milk cold and enjoy it as a refreshing and otherworldly treat, just like the characters in the Star Wars universe!
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Feel free to get creative with your Blue Milk and customize it to your taste. You can even add a touch of coconut flavor to make it more exotic. May the Force be with you as you savor this Star Wars-inspired beverage!</h4>
